  <p class="headline-small">A look at the factors that play a role in baby-making around the US</p>

</div>  


<div class="intro-section">
  <p class="intro-prose">While waiting out a storm, everyone eventually seems to start talking about one thing: babies. Or, rather, how the storm will cause enough people to cozy up that 9 months later they'll have a new bundle of joy. 
  </p>
  <p class="intro-prose">While the storm-induced-baby-boom urban legend may be one of the most popular hypotheses, the internet is frequently abuzz about what factors play a role in the timing of births. Evolutionary biology, SuperBowl wins, terrorist activity, large storms, people don't like having sex when it's too hot...the list of potential culprits goes on and on. 
  </p>
  <p class="intro-prose">So we decided to create a tool to (maybe) help settle some of these debates. Thanks to the US National Vital Statistics System, we were able to collect monthly-level birth data for all 31 million babies born in the US between 1995 and 2015. Here are some of the things we found most interesting:
  </p>
  <p class="section-title">For everything there is a season 
  </p>
  <p class="intro-prose">The first thing that we noticed is that births tend to be seasonal. But, this seasonal pattern varies slightly from one state to another. For instance, let's look at Maine, the furthest north of the continuous states.

  <div id="right-column">
    <p class="right-column-prose">Generally speaking, there is a plateau of births from May through August with fewer births in the winter months. That would put the highest rate of conception around August through December. In the fall, the leaves are changing and "Mainers" are gettin' busy.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Traveling down the east coast to the southernmost state, Florida, we see a different pattern. Instead of a summertime plateau, there is a more defined increase in births in the late summer and early fall, with a dip in spring and early summer. That places the highest conception time for Floridians around October to February.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">This same distinction between seasonality in southern states and northern ones is also visible on the west coast. Recognize this late-summer increase in births in California?</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Here's the familiar spring and summertime plateau in Washington state. </p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">It seems like latitude, or more likely climate, has some impact on the seasonality of conception and births in the US. This observation has been made in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2042520">several scientific studies</a>, many of which indicate that the extreme heat in the summertime (particularly in the southern US) may prohibit conception. Whether this effect is behavioral (people don't have as much sex when it's too hot out), physiological (both <a href="http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(13)00146-4/abstract?cc=y=">sperm motility</a> and <a href="http://www.paleoanthro.org/static/journal/content/PA20080172.pdf">ovarian function</a> may vary by season), or the result of some other cause is still up for debate. 
    <p class="right-column-prose">Outside of general climate impacts, there are regional urban legends about small-scale baby booms occurring 9 months after a large storm. The story seems to be that when large storms force people to be in one place for long periods of time (often without electricity) they get bored and well...you know the rest. But is it true? </p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Let's look at Hurricane Sandy, the storm that hit the northeast US in late October 2012. While the storm was raging on outside, a reported <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/30/hurricane-sandy-power-outages_n_2044016.html">8 million</a> homes and businesses lost power. Was there a baby boom 9 months later?</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Eh, Probably not. Looking at Suffolk County, NY (Long Island, an area hit particularly hard) there is no noticeable increase in births 9 months after the storm. 2013 was a low year for Suffolk County births in general, but the small spike in July appears to be consistent with seasonal patterns for the area. </p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">What about a blizzard? Well, Philadelphia experienced its worst blizzard in recent history in January 1996 when nearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_blizzard_of_1996#Philadelphia_and_Pennsylvania">28 inches of snow</a> fell in a 24 hour period.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">It doesn't look like this blizzard caused mini baby-booms in Philadelphia either. The number of births 9 months after the storm are just about typical for that time of year.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Another favorite theory of internet-goers is that after an epic sports win, fans celebrate (duh) and 9 months later...you guessed it. Babies.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">One such epic win happened in 2013 when the Seattle Seahawks won their very first Superbowl by the largest-ever margin of victory for an underdog team. While Seattleites love their sports teams, there doesn't seem to be an unusual increase in births 9 months after the game.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Perhaps baseball, the great American pastime, will be the cause of mini baby booms. Let's check out Boston, MA after their 2004 World Series Win (their first since 1918).</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Once again, there's no apparent baby-boom. And in this case, the late summer of 2005 (9 months after the win) saw the fewest summer-Boston-babies of all 21 years.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">So then, what does cause the variation in birthdays across the US? The short answer: we still don't know. Perhaps it's some combination of everything mentioned above. Maybe people are actually <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00314?journalCode=rest#.WPmlqVPysWq">planning their pregnancies</a> and aiming to have newborns in late summer instead of winter (even if that means being seriously pregnant in the hottest months of the year).</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">What we can say is that the distribution of human conception and births is complicated. But at least you now have a tool to pull up every time you argue with someone about whether that storm/sports win/etc. caused an increase in births.</p>
