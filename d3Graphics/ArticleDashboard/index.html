<div class="intro-section">
  <p class="intro-prose">Next time you find yourself in a large group of people looking for a fun parlor trick, try betting that two people in the room share the same birthday. If you're simply looking for a month/day match between two people, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">math sorcery</a> suggests you've got a 50% chance of finding one in a group of 23 people. If you hang out with larger crowds, say 70 people or so, you've got a 99.9% chance of two people sharing a birthday. 
  </p>
  <p class="intro-prose">Now, of course, this is an estimate based on probability, but it's likely that your chances of finding a match are even better than expected. You see, this estimate assumes that people are just as likely to be born on any day of the year. But, if you have ever jumped from one birthday party to another in August only to find your social calendar suspiciously empty in February, you probably already know that that's not the case. 
  </p>
  <p class="intro-prose">In the United States, the highest number of babies are born in July through September, and the fewest are born in January. The internet is filled with hypotheses as to why this is the case and, understandably, most of them revolve around conditions that may impact conception. Evolutionary biology, SuperBowl wins, terrorist activity, large storms, people don't like having sex when it's too hot...the list of potential culprits goes on and on. This piqued our curiosity so we decided to analyze the trends in birth timing for over 31 million babies.
  </p>
  <p class="intro-prose">All of our data came from the US' National Vital Statistics System, which reports monthly level birth data for all babies born in the US. Here, we'll present births from 1995 - 2015 for 445 US counties and all 50 states. 
  </p>
  <p class="intro-prose">The first thing that we noticed is that births do seem to be seasonal. But, this seasonal pattern varies slightly from one state to another. For instance, let's look at Maine, the furthest north of the continuous states.

  <div id="right-column">
    <p class="right-column-prose">Each line represents one year from 1995 - 2015. While there is some variation from year to year, the overall trend remains the same.  </p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">If we combine the data for all 21 years, we can clearly see a plateau of births from May through August with fewer births in the winter months. That would put the highest rate of conception around August through December. In the fall, the leaves are changing and "Mainers" are gettin' busy.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Traveling down the east coast to the southernmost continuous state, Florida, we see a different pattern. Instead of a summertime plateau, there is a more defined increase in births in the late summer and early fall. That places the highest conception time for Floridians around October to February.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">This same distinction between seasonality in southern states and northern ones is also visible on the west coast. Recognize this late-summer increase in births in California?</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Here's the familiar spring and summertime plateau in Washington state. </p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">It seems like latitude, or more likely climate, has some impact on the seasonality of conception and births in the US. This observation has been made in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2042520">several scientific studies</a>, many of which indicate that the extreme heat in the summertime (particularly in the southern US) may prohibit conception. Whether this effect is behavioral (people don't have as much sex when it's too hot out), physiological (both <a href="http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(13)00146-4/abstract?cc=y=">sperm motility</a> and <a href="http://www.paleoanthro.org/static/journal/content/PA20080172.pdf">ovarian function</a> may vary by season), or the result of some other cause is still up for debate. 
    <p class="right-column-prose">Outside of general climate impacts, there are regional urban legends about small-scale baby booms occurring 9 months after a large storm. The story seems to be that when large storms force people to be in one place for long periods of time (often without electricity) they get bored and well...you know the rest. But is it true? </p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Let's look at Hurricane Sandy, the storm that hit the northeast US in late October 2012. While the storm was raging on outside, a reported <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/30/hurricane-sandy-power-outages_n_2044016.html">8 million</a> homes and businesses lost power. Was there a baby boom 9 months later?</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Eh, Probably not. Looking at Suffolk County, NY (Long Island, an area hit particularly hard) there is no noticeable increase in births 9 months after the storm. 2013 was a low year for Suffolk County births in general, but the small spike in July appears to be consistent with seasonal patterns for the area. </p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">What about a blizzard? Well, Philadelphia experienced its worst blizzard in recent history in January 1996 when nearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_blizzard_of_1996#Philadelphia_and_Pennsylvania">28 inches of snow</a> fell in a 24 hour period.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">It doesn't look like this blizzard caused mini baby-booms in Philadelphia either. The number of births 9 months after the storm are just about typical for that time of year.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Another favorite theory of internet-goers is that after an epic sports win, fans celebrate (duh) and 9 months later...you guessed it. Babies.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">One such epic win happened in 2013 when the Seattle Seahawks won their very first Superbowl by the largest-ever margin of victory for an underdog team. While Seattleites love their sports teams, there doesn't seem to be an unusual increase in births 9 months after the game.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Perhaps baseball, the great American pastime, will be the cause of mini baby booms. Let's check out Boston, MA after their 2004 World Series Win (their first since 1918).</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">Once again, there's no apparent baby-boom. And in this case, the late summer of 2005 (9 months after the win) saw the fewest summer-Boston-babies of all 21 years.</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">So then, what does cause the variation in birthdays across the US? The short answer: we still don't know. Perhaps it's some combination of everything mentioned above. Maybe people are actually <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00314?journalCode=rest#.WPmlqVPysWq">planning their pregnancies</a> and aiming to have newborns in late summer instead of winter (even if that means being seriously pregnant in the hottest months of the year).</p>
    <p class="right-column-prose">What we can say is that the distribution of human conception and births is complicated. But at least you now have a tool to pull up every time you argue with someone about whether that storm/sports win/etc. caused an increase in births.</p>
